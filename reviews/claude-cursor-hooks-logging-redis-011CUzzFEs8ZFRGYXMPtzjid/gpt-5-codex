## Review Summary

### Findings
- **Critical** – Cursor telemetry hooks never obtain a session id. `SessionManager` writes IDs to workspace state and a storage file instead of setting real environment variables, while every hook only calls `os.environ.get('CURSOR_SESSION_ID')`. That leaves `self.session_id` empty, stops `MessageQueueWriter` from instantiating, and drops every event (`src/capture/cursor/extension/src/sessionManager.ts`, `src/capture/cursor/hook_base.py`, spec §3.2).
- **Critical** – Config loading fails once hooks are copied into `.cursor/hooks`. The installer relocates YAML into `~/.blueplane`, but `Config()` only looks for a sibling `config/` directory relative to the hook files, raising `FileNotFoundError` and preventing Redis configuration from ever loading (`src/capture/shared/config.py`, `scripts/install_cursor.py`, spec §1.1).
- **High** – Privacy policy breach: `after_mcp_execution.py` forwards the raw `error_message` field, even though `privacy.yaml` opts out of error messages and requires redaction, and `PrivacySanitizer` is a no-op (`config/privacy.yaml`, `src/capture/cursor/hooks/after_mcp_execution.py`, spec §1.3).
- **High** – MCP success flag is parsed incorrectly. `argparse` with `type=bool` treats any non-empty string as `True`, so failed executions (e.g. `"False"`) are logged as successful (`src/capture/cursor/hooks/after_mcp_execution.py`, spec §3.1).
- **Medium** – Events omit the required `version` field mandated by the documented JSON schema; neither `Event` nor the hook payloads populate it, so consumers expecting the schema will break (`docs/architecture/layer1_capture.md`, `src/capture/shared/event_schema.py`).

### Questions
- Should hooks read the session context from the extension’s workspace storage/file instead, or do we expect the extension to expose real process environment variables for compliance with the spec?
